VoteAmerica provides a handful of products for other organizations to use:

* [VoteAmerica software:](software/index.md) A complete suite of tools that help citizens check their registration status, register to vote, request an absentee or mail-in ballot, find out where to vote, and contact their local elections office.
* [Civic Data API](api/index.md): 80+ rigorously fact-checked data points per state, covering everything from voter ID laws to voter registration deadlines.

The tools are free to use and embed on your website. If you'd like access to the data that comes in via a dedicated instance of our software, you'll need to sign up for a VoteAmerica+ account.  You'll also need to sign up for a VoteAmerica+ account if you'd like to use the Civic Data API.

- Contact [sales@voteamerica.com](mailto:sales@voteamerica.com) for more information on VoteAmerica+ accounts.

VoteAmerica is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.  VoteAmerica+ accounts are managed via VoteAmerica LLC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of VoteAmerica. We do this for accounting purposes: everyone's life is just easier if software licensing is handled via a distinct legal entity.

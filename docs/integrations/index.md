VoteAmerica+ has integrations with partners including:

# [ActionNetwork](/integrations/action_network/)

When a user makes use of a VoteAmerica+ software embed, we collect their contact information. This can be
passed to ActionNetwork to add the user to your email list and/or trigger an Action to inform targeting or ladder conditions.

# Other platforms

You can also integrate your VoteAmerica+ software with several popular platforms:
* [Report events to Facebook (Meta) Pixel](/integrations/meta_pixel/)
* [Report events to Google Tag Manager](/integrations/gtm/)
* [Embed voter tools on a Wordpress website](/integrations/wordpress/)

# Coming soon

We are developing an integration with Community Tech Alliance's [Hopper](https://communitytechalliance.org/hopper).

VoteAmerica+ has integrations with a number of partners and platforms.

# [ActionNetwork](/integrations/action_network/)

When a user makes use of a VoteAmerica+ software embed, we collect their contact information. This can be
passed to ActionNetwork to add the user to your email list and/or trigger an Action to inform targeting or ladder conditions.

# [The Movement Cooperative](/integrations/the_movement_cooperative/)

VoteAmerica+ works with The Movement Cooperative
to provide easy syncs of your data to your TMC Civis account. If you are a
TMC member, VoteAmerica+ and TMC can automatically sync your data to your
Civis account.

# [Learning Management Systems](/integrations/learning_management_systems/)

VoteAmerica+ works with Blackboard and Canvas LMSs to make voter registration easy and convenient.
If you are an LMS administrator you can add the VoteAmerica+ Register to Vote tool to your instance.

# Overview

VoteAmerica+ software can be embedded in other websites with a short snippet of code. This will load our tool asynchronously via Javascript into a div with the class `voteamerica-embed`. This will not block rendering of the parent page, and the iframe will check the URL of the parent page for [tracking URL arguments](/toolset/tracking/).

The software has minimal branding, and the fonts and color scheme should work with any website design.

## Free software

VoteAmerica's software is free for anyone to use. You can find the code to embed it on your website on the [VoteAmerica website](https://www.voteamerica.com/embeds/).

## VoteAmerica+ software

If you'd like access to the information gathered via an instance of our software, you'll need a VoteAmerica+ subscription.  Please contact [sales@voteamerica.com](mailto:sales@voteamerica.com) to discuss pricing.

Existing subscribers will find their unique embed code on the dashboard. Log in at [https://secure.voteamerica.com/](https://secure.voteamerica.com/).
